//IMPLEMENTATIONS
# Multiple commands in the same line
  - When dealing with a list, runcmd() will fork().
  - The child will call runcmd() to execute the leftmost command in a listcmd struct.
  - The parent will call runcmd() and continue processing the remainder (right side) of the list.
  - This continues until all the commands in a list are processed.
  
# Command pipeline
  - Casting cmd to pipecmd struct allows for getting of left and right arguments of the pipe 
  - Create pipe with p[0] as as read end and p[1] as write end
  - Create child process that runs the command to the left of pipe
  - Command running process is with done with runcmd after changing output to pipe rather than terminal
  - Same process is repeated for the right side of the pipe but instead of changing output, input is changed to read from pipe
  - Close pipes and wait for the child processes to finish executing
  
# Input and output redirection
  - Using the information already in the redircmd struct, we close the necesarry file descriptor entry.
  - We then open() the relevant file with the needed arguments from redircmd's file and mode variables.
  - We then call runcmd() to execute the cmd specified.
  
# Command background execution

# Command history
  - In the main() function, the forked child moves to execution while the parent calls addhist().
  - addhist() adds the user input to an array of commands stored within sh.c (if the input is not a basic hist command).
  - addhist() also updates the array to delete the oldest command so that only 10 are stored at a time.
  - When executing a command in runcmd(), check to see if it is hist print or hist 1-10.
  - If so, call either printhist() to print the history list or runhist() to call runcmd() for the command from history
